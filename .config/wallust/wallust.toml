# wallust configuration - for wallust version 3.0

# How the image is parse, in order to get the colors:
# full - resized - wal - thumb -  fastresize - kmeans
backend = "wal"

# What color space to use to produce and select the most prominent colors:
# lab - labmixed - lch - lchmixed - lchansi
color_space = "lchmixed"

# Dark	             8 dark colors, dark background and light contrast
# Dark16	           Same as dark but uses the 16 colors trick
# DarkComp	         This is a dark variant that changes all colors to it's complementary counterpart, giving the feeling of a 'new palette' but that still makes sense with the image provided.
# DarkComp16	       16 variation of the dark complementary variant
# AnsiDark	         This is not a 'dark' variant, is a new palette that is meant to work with lchansi colorspace, which will maintain 'tty' like color order and only adjusting the colors acording to the theme. A possible solution for LS_COLORS and the like. Should workout with other colorspace, but the result may not be optimal.
# AnsiDark16	       The ansidark palette with 16 color variation.
# HardDark	         Same as dark with hard hue colors
# HardDark16	       Harddark with 16 color variation
# HardDarkComp	     complementary colors variation of harddark scheme
# HardDarkComp16	   complementary colors variation of harddark scheme
# Light	             Light bg, dark fg
# Light16	           Same as light but uses the 16 color trick
# LightComp	         complementary colors variation of light
# LightComp16	       complementary colors variation of light with the 16 color variation
# SoftDark	         Variant of softlight, uses the lightest colors and a dark background (could be interpreted as dark inversed)
# SoftDark16	       softdark with 16 color variation
# SoftDarkComp	     complementary variation for softdark
# SoftDarkComp16	   complementary variation for softdark with the 16 color variation
# SoftLight	         Light with soft pastel colors, counterpart of harddark
# SoftLight16	       softlight with 16 color variation
# SoftLightComp	     softlight with complementary colors
# SoftLightComp16	   softlight with complementary colors with 16 colors
